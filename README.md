This is the MATLAB code for the following submission  to ICDM 2023: 
Multi-Label Personalized Classification via Exclusive Sparse Tensor Factorization （MLPC）. 

Please make sure to download tensor toolbox v3.5 and add it to path before running the code. (You can browse http://www.tensortoolbox.org/ to get more information)

Please run 'demo.m' to demonstrate an experiment of MLPC on a synthetic dataset with p = 2 and q = 2.

Please run 'plot_convergence' to demonstrate an experiment of MLPC on a real-world dataset.

For more information on MLPC, please type 'help MLPC'  under MATLAB prompt.
